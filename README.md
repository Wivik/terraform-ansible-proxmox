# Terraform + Ansible + Proxmox

This repository contains Terraform and Ansible scripts I've used to create my VMs and install my services on a Proxmox Virutalization server. These versions are modified for example purpose because it's very specific to my needs.

Feel free to use them as an inspiration. They're provided without any waranty !

The Ansible roles were made for CentOS only.

This is just a sharing of personal tools, they're maintained inside a private Gitea instance.
